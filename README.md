## Download

[Click here](https://github.com/thiagodnf/jmetrics/releases) to download the latest version of this tool 

## Features

This tool supports the following features:
- Metrics
    - Hypervolume
    - HypervolumeApprox
    - Epsilon
    - GD
    - IGD
    - IGDPlus
    - Spread
    - ErrorRatio
    - Contribution
    - ProportionalContribution
    
- Generate an approximate pareto-front
- Export the results as .csv files

## Usage

To see all options, just type:

```sh
$ jmetrics --help
```

The output:

```bash
Usage: jmetrics [-h] [-s=<separator>] [-m=<metrics>...]... folder
Evaluating Pareto-fronts generated by jMetal Framework
      folder   folder that has the input files
  -h, --help   display this help and exit
  -m, --metrics=<metrics>...
               set the metrics to be calculated
               values: Hypervolume, HypervolumeApprox, Epsilon, GD, IGD, IGDPlus, Spread, ErrorRatio, Contribution, ProportionalContribution, ALL
               default: [Hypervolume, IGD, Contribution,ProportionalContribution]
  -s, --separator=<separator>
               set the column separator
               values: Comma, SemiColon, Colon, Bar, Tab, Space
               default: Space

```

For example:

```bash
$ jmetrics src/target-folder -s comma --metrics hypervolume igd
```

If there is no ```pareto-front.txt``` in this folder, the tool will generante an approximate pareto-front based on the files and save it into the same directory. If everything is ok, a ```result.csv``` is going to be generated.

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications for free! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:
